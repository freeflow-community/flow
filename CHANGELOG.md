# Changelog

Convention: every feature/fix entry tags the platforms it landed on —
`[server]` `[web]` `[macos]` `[ios]` `[qa]`. A change that lands on one client
but not the others MUST add a line to **Parity** below (and remove it when
closed). Updated with every milestone commit (PM) and interactive-session fix
(coordinator).

## Parity

### Gaps to close
- Phase 11 unfurls: **macOS and iOS don't render link preview cards** — they
  ignore `MessageDTO.unfurls`, so previews are web-only for now. The §10
  settings UI (per-user "don't unfurl my links", per-workspace
  switch/allowlist) is missing on *every* client, web included — API-only.
- macOS: phase 10 notification settings — no Notifications section in the
  profile/settings UI, banner path doesn't consult `suppressAlert` yet, and
  the status picker doesn't set `status_suppress_alerts` (web shipped
  2026-07-21; iOS out of scope for phase 10 per spec).
- iOS: no Artifacts UI (phase 9) — no sidebar section, artifact panel, or
  save-as-artifact action; the `artifact.*` WS events are safely ignored.
  Server + web + macOS shipped together 2026-07-21.
- macOS/iOS: no agent pairing prompt — sponsors must approve agent
  registrations in the web app (the `agent.pairing` WS event is safely ignored
  by the native clients; roster `sponsorId` likewise unused there yet).
- macOS/iOS: video playback downloads the whole file before playing (streamed
  to disk, not RAM); web streams in place via the presigned URL. Matters at
  the new 500 MB scale — native fix is AVPlayer on the `/v1/files/:id/url`
  presigned URL.
- iOS: no mention-of-non-member CTA after @mentioning someone outside the
  channel (web + macOS offer "Add to channel" — matters most for agents, which
  never see mentions in channels they haven't joined). iOS has its own composer
  (not the shared macOS one), so the CTA needs porting there.
- macOS: sidebar doesn't list DM-less agents under Direct Messages (web shows
  virtual rows with presence + 🤖 that create the DM on click).
- Web composer: browser-native undo degrades after programmatic splices
  (autocomplete/suggestion inserts) — contenteditable limitation; macOS undo is clean.
- macOS: pasting a non-image file URL inserts its path as text; web handles
  arbitrary files via drop/picker. (Drag-drop attach works on both.)
- Web: one session token per browser origin — two accounts in two tabs collide
  (macOS profiles handle multi-account). Candidate phase-3-adjacent fix.
- macOS: workspace-chooser tiles ignore AX activation (real click required) — a11y gap.
- No syntax highlighting in code blocks (both clients; never scoped).
- iOS: no push notifications (APNs — deferred to a follow-on phase; needs
  server device-token registry + Apple push key + device testing). Everything
  else in core messaging + files is now at parity.
- macOS has no in-app registration, password-reset, or passwordless sign-in
  link against real servers — by design it links to the web (email-first flow +
  app-link handoff); the dev-only autoVerify register remains for the local dev
  server. (iOS same — auth is web-driven.)
- iOS: no inline video preview/playback card — video attachments render as a
  name+size chip that opens in QuickLook (which does play them); web/macOS
  render inline players with an expand affordance.

### Deliberate divergences (ruled)
- Copy message text: explicit "Copy" item in the message menu on iOS + macOS
  (their custom Text rows aren't natively selectable); web omits it because
  browser text selection + Cmd/Ctrl-C already copies message text.
- Emoji picker: custom grid + search on web and iOS (reaction sheet); native
  character palette on macOS.
- iOS composer: plain text + @-mention autocomplete only — no live-styled
  fence/code composer (PM ruling per phase7.md recommendation, pending
  operator review). Markdown still renders fully; sugar expands at send time.
- iOS message actions: long-press context menu (no hover on touch).
- App management UI (Slack-compat apps): web only.
- Agent-skill download link on the logged-out home: web only — the native
  clients link out to the web for the whole signed-out/auth surface (see the
  in-app-registration divergence in Gaps), so the skill CTA lives there too.
- Agent management UI (agents roster, remove agent, pairing approval): web
  only (operator ruling 4, like Apps). All clients render the 🤖 badge.
- User admin panel (Manage Users — role changes + remove from workspace):
  web only, consistent with Apps/Agents management UIs. macOS shows neither the
  menu item nor the sidebar row. The server endpoints are platform-neutral, so
  a macOS UI can be added later. See History 2026-07-21.
- Local per-device (not synced) prefs: sidebar width, thread-panel width,
  image collapsed/expanded state (ruled).
- webm videos play inline on web only: AVFoundation has no VP8/VP9/webm
  support, so macOS shows the file chip (Download / open externally) for
  webm attachments (ruled — see decision_log 2026-07-20).
- Responsive/mobile layout (drawer nav, viewport-capped media and modals):
  web only, and inherently so — the native clients lay themselves out per
  platform, and the iOS app is the native phone experience. Not a gap.
