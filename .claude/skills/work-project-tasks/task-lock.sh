# A cross-machine lock for a queue batch, held as a git ref on GitHub.
#
#   task-lock.sh claim   <key>     # 0 = you own it, 1 = someone else does
#   task-lock.sh release <key>     # always 0, missing lock is not an error
#   task-lock.sh list              # every held lock: key, holder, age
#   task-lock.sh sweep [hours]     # print locks older than N hours (default 2)
#
# WHY A REF AND NOT THE STATUS FIELD
#
# Setting Status to "In Progress" is a signal, not a claim. Projects V2 has no
# conditional update — `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` is last-write-wins with
# no "only if it is currently Queued for Dev". Two machines can both read the
# item as queued, both write In Progress, and both start the same work.
#
# Creating a git ref *is* a compare-and-swap: POST /git/refs returns 201 to
# exactly one caller and 422 "Reference already exists" to the rest, decided on
# GitHub's side with no timing assumptions. That makes it a real lock, and it
# works from any machine — which a local flock cannot.
#
# The refs live under refs/flow-locks/, not refs/heads/, so they never appear
# as branches in the UI, in `git branch -a`, or in anyone's fetch.
#
# The ref points at a parentless commit whose message and author date record
# who took the lock and when. A ref alone carries no timestamp, so without it a
# dead lock is indistinguishable from a live one and `sweep` has nothing to read.
