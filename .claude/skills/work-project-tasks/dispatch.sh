# Installed as a LaunchAgent that fires every few minutes — see
# com.freeflow.flow-dispatcher.plist. Nothing here is Flow-specific: it decides
# *whether* to dispatch, and `claude -p` plus SKILL.md do the rest.
#
# PERMISSIONS: THE DISPATCHED RUN BYPASSES THEM
#
# The run takes a batch all the way to a PR, so it needs git, pnpm, swift,
# xcodebuild and gh — and it is unattended, so there is nobody to answer a
# prompt. The first live run proved the failure mode: it wrote the whole of
# #260, then could not commit, build or push, and blocked itself with the code
# stranded in a worktree.
#
# `claude -p` gets no Flow MCP tools (those come from the agent-bridge, not
# from any .mcp.json), so it cannot create_channel or start_task. It therefore
# takes SKILL.md's inline fallback and does the work itself. Two consequences
# worth being clear about:
#
#   - There is no #task-N channel for a dispatched batch. Progress lives in
#     this log and in the PR, not in Flow. Wiring the bridge's MCP into this
#     invocation would restore the hand-off, and is the better long-term shape.
#   - bypassPermissions means an unattended agent can run anything on this
#     machine as this user. Operator decision, taken knowingly (Scott,
#     2026-08-16). The guards below are what bounds it: no dispatch during a
#     release, a concurrency cap, and one run at a time per machine.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
#
# It does not claim the batch. Claiming belongs with the run that does the work,
# so the skill takes the cross-machine lock (task-lock.sh) as its first act. If
# two machines tick at the same moment, both may start a run and one will lose
# the lock and exit in seconds — which is cheap, and correct.
#
# The local flock below is not the lock that matters. It stops ONE machine
# racing itself when a tick runs long; the git ref is what stops two machines
# taking the same work.
