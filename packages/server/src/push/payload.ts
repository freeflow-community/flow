// APNs payload builder (#248, PUSH_APNS.md § "The payload").
//
// Pure functions, no DB: the outbox (#247) hydrates the row and this turns it
// into the bytes APNs carries. Split out of pushOutbox.ts so the shape can be
// tested — and read — without a database.
//
// Two contracts this file is not free to redesign:
//
//  1. The custom keys are the SAME keys the macOS banner already puts in its
//     `userInfo` (Banners.swift): workspaceId, channelId, messageId and
//     threadRootId-when-present. That is what lets iOS tap-routing reuse the
//     existing `AppState.openNotification` path instead of growing a second
//     one. `notificationId` is the one addition — a tap needs to mark exactly
//     this row read. Do not rename any of them for tidiness.
//  2. The alert strings are the same strings the macOS banner builds in
//     SyncEngine's `.notification` case, so a mention that reads one way on
//     the Mac does not read another way on the phone. `alertStringsFor` below
//     is a straight port of that switch; `plainText` is a port of
//     MentionRendering.plainText. When one moves, move the other — #466/#472
//     moved both, since the mistitled `default:` was in each of them.
//     The one place they differ is kind 3's channel name: this builder has the
//     conversation hydrated, the local banner does not and says the generic
//     string instead.
