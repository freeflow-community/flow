// Silent badge-sync pushes (#248, PUSH_APNS.md § "Silent pushes keep the badge
// honest").
//
// The counterpart to the alert push: read a mention on your laptop and the
// phone in your pocket should drop its badge. Every `notification.read` event
// already carries the fresh total, so this mirrors it to the user's devices as
// a background push — no alert, no sound, just the count, applied in
// `didReceiveRemoteNotification` without waking the UI.
//
// Deliberately NOT through `pending_push`. That outbox exists because a missed
// *notification* is one the user never learns about; a missed badge correction
// is self-healing — the next read or the next alert carries the current count,
// and the count is absolute rather than a delta. Durability would buy an
// at-least-once guarantee on a number that is stale by the time it is retried.
//
// Three suppressions, all because Apple meters background pushes on a per-app
// budget and an app that burns it stops getting them delivered at all:
//
//   1. THROTTLE — at most one per user per WINDOW_MS, trailing-edge, so a
//      sweep that reads forty rows one at a time sends one push, not forty.
//   2. REDUNDANCY — dropped outright when an alert push to the same user has
//      landed since this sync was queued. That alert carried a badge computed
//      after the read committed, so it is at least as fresh as anything this
//      sync could say. The spec asks only for the equal-count case; dropping on
//      any later alert is the same idea taken one step further, and it also
//      stops a coalesced sync from re-asserting a count the alert has since
//      moved past.
//   3. HOURLY BUDGET (#251) — at most BACKGROUND_PUSHES_PER_HOUR per user per
//      rolling hour. (1) bounds a burst and does nothing about an hour: at one
//      push per 30 s, a person working a busy workspace all morning spends 120
//      of them, and someone reading once every two minutes still spends 30 —
//      both an order of magnitude past what Apple will deliver. Measured, not
//      assumed: `test/badgeSyncBudget.test.ts` replays those profiles through
//      this module and counts. Over budget iOS delays or drops the pushes
//      itself, which is the same staleness this cap causes but chosen by
//      someone who cannot see which count matters — better to spend the
//      allowance deliberately.
//
// The cap HOLDS rather than drops: the newest count stays pending and goes out
// when the oldest send in the window ages out. A badge is absolute, so an hour
// of heavy reading owes the phone exactly one truthful number, and dropping
// would leave it owing nothing.
//
// The state is per process. With several replicas the throttle is per replica —
// acceptable, because a user's read requests are not sharded by user and Apple's
// own budget is the real backstop; a durable cross-replica throttle would cost
// a round trip per read to save a push nobody asked for.
