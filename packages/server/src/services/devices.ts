 *
 * The conflict target is `token` alone, deliberately. A phone handed to
 * someone else re-registers the same token under the new account, and this
 * must **rebind** the row to the new user rather than insert a second one —
 * otherwise the previous owner's notifications keep landing on a phone that is
 * no longer theirs. `disabled_at` is cleared too: a token APNs once answered
 * 410 for is live again the moment a device asks for it back.
