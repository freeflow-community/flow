// Community email (#481): an owner/admin broadcasts one message to every human
// member of a workspace, composed in the web Directory.
//
// Two rules shape this file. First, the *renderer is the single source of
// truth* — `previewBroadcast` and `sendBroadcast` both call
// renderBroadcastEmailHtml, so the composer's Preview tab is showing the
// literal output of the send path rather than a re-implementation of it.
// Second, a broadcast is a batch of independent sends: one address that
// bounces must not cost the other N-1 people their email, so each send is
// awaited inside its own try and only tallied.
