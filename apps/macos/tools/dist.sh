# Env contract (§2 of the spec):
#   FLOW_SIGN_IDENTITY  Developer ID Application identity (required)
#   FLOW_NOTARY_PROFILE notarytool keychain profile name (required)
#   FLOW_SERVER_URL     server the build points at (optional; make-app.sh default)
#
# Runs identically locally and in CI. Holds no secrets — signing uses an
# identity already in the keychain, notarization a stored keychain profile.
# Never falls back to ad-hoc signing: a missing identity aborts the run, because
# an ad-hoc build cannot be notarized.
