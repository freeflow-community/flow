# --- Embed Sparkle (auto-update) + LiveKit's XCFrameworks (voice huddle) -----
# SwiftPM resolves these as XCFrameworks but, unlike Xcode, does nothing to put
# them inside the bundle: without this the app launches and immediately dies on
# a missing @rpath/<Name>.framework. Copy each macOS slice, then teach the
# executable to look in Contents/Frameworks (SwiftPM emits @loader_path and the
# toolchain paths, neither of which finds it). LiveKit ships two — its Rust
# core (RustLiveKitUniFFI) and WebRTC (LiveKitWebRTC) — same treatment as
# Sparkle, one rpath covers all three.
